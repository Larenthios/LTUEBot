# LTUE BOT
## Prerequisites
### Install python & pip packages

### Get the access tokens
First, you'll need to get the access tokens for the get_long_token script
* `appid` and `clientsecret` can be retrived from [your apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) > The relevant app > Settings > General
* access token can be generated by going [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) and clicking the big blue button. **You should select the appropriate authorizations such as `pages_read_engagement` and `pages_show_list`**

Running the script will give you a long-lived access token. Very cool !
get that token into "config.ini" under fb user

_Et voil√†_ !
